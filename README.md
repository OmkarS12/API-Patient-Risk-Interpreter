Returns the HCC risk profile of a given patient information.

API to compute risk profile of a patient based on CMS guidelines and Software prototype, Risk Score of a patient based on demographics, insurance category and diagnosis of Chronic Conditions. The adjusted risk Score (RAF Score) helps to predict the reimbursement a provider will receive for the patient. It depends on the weights assigned to the chronic conditions. Sometimes, these chronic conditions gets unnoticed and are not documented properly therefore leading to decreased RAF score and less
reimbursement. Through this project we are aiming to include all the ICDs that are documented in the patientâ€™s chart which count towards the total weight of the RAF score.
Implementation in FASTAPI.
